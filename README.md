[...this.products], is known as the spread syntax in JavaScript.

<code>
// Example 1: Spread operator with arrays
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const moreNumbers = [4, 5, 6];

// Combining two arrays using the spread operator
const combinedNumbers = [...numbers, ...moreNumbers];

console.log(combinedNumbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

// Example 2: Spread operator with objects
const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
};

// Adding new property to an object using the spread operator
const updatedPerson = {
    ...person,
    country: 'USA',
};

console.log(updatedPerson); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 30, country: 'USA' }

// Example 3: Spread operator with function arguments
const numbersToAdd = [5, 10, 15];

// Using spread operator to pass array elements as arguments to a function
const sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;

const result = sum(...numbersToAdd);

console.log(result); // Output: 30

</code>

## Array Spread Operator Example

<code>
const products = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

const copiedProducts = [...products];

copiedProducts.push('grape');
console.log(products); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
console.log(copiedProducts); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']
</code>

## Object Spread Operator Example

<code>
const product = {
    name: 'Apple',
    price: 1.99,
    category: 'Fruit'
};

const copiedProduct = { ...product };

copiedProduct.price = 2.49;
console.log(product); // Output: { name: 'Apple', price: 1.99, category: 'Fruit' }
console.log(copiedProduct); // Output: { name: 'Apple', price: 2.49, category: 'Fruit' }

</code>


### Connecting Nest with Mongodb

# Installing Command of Mongoose command in Nest Application
<code>npm install --save mongoose @nestjs/mongoose</code>

<p>
After installing successfully mongoose Import it in app module file because it is a root file.

<ul>
<li>Import <strong>ModuleMongoose</strong> from <i>@nest/mongoose</i> package</li>
<li>After importing MongooseModule add in in import array such as 
<code>
MongooseModule.forRoot("MongoDB connect URL")
<code>
</li>
</ul>

Now we define Product Schema model for different purposes such as

<ol>
<li>Data Structure Definition</li>
<li>Validation</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Integration with Frameworks and Libraries</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
</ol>

The product model looks like this

<code>
import * as mongoose from 'mongoose'

export const ProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title:{type:String,required:true},
    price:{type:String,required:true},
    description:{type:String,required:true}
})
</code>

Now also add Mongoose Module in product module as well

<li>Import <strong>ModuleMongoose</strong> from <i>@nest/mongoose</i> package</li>
<li>After importing MongooseModule add in in import array such as 
<code>
MongooseModule.forFeature([{}])
<code>
</p>

<p>After all the above steps the most important will start which is actually we inject models in service file because all methods ar present at that place or file.</p>

## How we can Inject Model in service file

<p>First Import <strong>InjectModel</strong> with the help of @nest/mongoose which is actually </p>

<p>
Second is add constructor and use in it

<code>
constructor(@InjectModel('Product) private readonly productModel:Model<Product>)
</code>

@InjectModel('Product'): This is a decorator provided by @nestjs/mongoose. It's used to inject a Mongoose model into a NestJS class. The argument 'Product' specifies the name of the model to inject. This name should match the name used when defining the model in Mongoose.

private readonly productModel: Model<Product>: This is a property declaration in the constructor. It's declaring a private property named productModel of type Model<Product>. Model<Product> is a generic type provided by Mongoose. It represents the Mongoose model for the 'Product' collection.

Model<Product> is a class constructor function that provides methods for interacting with the MongoDB collection corresponding to the 'Product' model.

Product is the TypeScript interface or class representing the schema of the 'Product' documents. This provides type safety when working with documents returned from the MongoDB collection.
</p>

## Why install new mongoose command?
<code>npm install --save-dev  @types/mongoose</code>
<p>
The command npm install --save-dev @types/mongoose is used to install TypeScript type definitions for the Mongoose library in a Node.js project.

Here's why you would use this command:

Type Definitions: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. Mongoose is a JavaScript library for MongoDB object modeling. However, since JavaScript itself doesn't have built-in support for types, using TypeScript with Mongoose can sometimes lead to type errors or lack of type checking.

TypeScript Support: To take full advantage of TypeScript's type checking capabilities when working with Mongoose in a Node.js project, you need type definitions that describe the structure of Mongoose objects and functions. These type definitions provide TypeScript with the necessary information to perform type checking and ensure type safety in your code.

Development Dependency: The --save-dev flag indicates that the package being installed is a development dependency. This means that the @types/mongoose package is only required during development, specifically for type checking and development-time tooling support. It's not needed in production environments where TypeScript code is typically transpiled to JavaScript before deployment.

By running npm install --save-dev @types/mongoose, you ensure that the necessary type definitions for Mongoose are installed in your project, enabling TypeScript to provide accurate type checking and better developer tooling support when working with Mongoose in a Node.js application.
